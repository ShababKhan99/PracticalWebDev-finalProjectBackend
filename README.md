# Fullstack CRUD Application #
### Platform For Managing Students and Campuses

### Goal
Using Node, Express, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize, build a RESTful full-stack web application to manage students and campuses. This will cover all of the CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This will encompass writing models, querying a database with an ORM, designing routes/endpoints and handler functions to process user requests and generate responses, writing out React Components, managing the state of the application with React-Redux, and much more. This will also involve having two individual repositories/applications (a separate server and a separate client), which encourages separation of concerns and modularity.
